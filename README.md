# hello-go
Very simple go hello world app

# How to run
To run this, make sure you have go installed and then run:
```
go run hello.go
```
That should run the app. If you would like to build the project into an executable file, run:
```
go build
```
And that will give you an executable called, "hello" that you can simple double click and run.
